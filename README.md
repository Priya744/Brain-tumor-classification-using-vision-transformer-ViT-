# Brain-tumor-classification-using-vision-transformer-ViT-
A brain tumor is a growth of cells in or near the brain, multiplying abnormally and uncontrollably. These tumors can occur in brain tissue or nearby areas like nerves and glands. They are classified as primary if they start in the brain or secondary (metastatic) if they spread from other body parts. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous), with the latter being more aggressive and invasive. Symptoms depend on the tumor's size and location. Treatment options, such as surgery and radiation, vary accordingly.

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a model for image classification using a Transformer-like architecture on image patches. An image is divided into fixed-size patches, linearly embedded, and combined with positional embeddings. This sequence is fed into a Transformer encoder, and an extra learnable “classification token” is added for classification tasks. This architecture effectively handles brain tumor classification by analyzing medical images in a structured, systematic manner.
